- 👋 Hi, I’m @Colton-MK
      - The Run Down: I'm an engineer and am new to programming. I have some academic exposure to MATLAB. On my own, I've done some experimenting with HTML, CSS, C++, and Python.
                      I'm also a pretty big Taekwondo fanatic.
- 👀 I’m interested in robotics, gui automation, and computer decision making.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, PLC ladder logic, and basic Computer Science such as hardware and networking fundamentals.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on (nothing at the moment, as I want to get some basic skills and write a few more low level projects before messing with anything important)
- 📫 How to reach me (I'll figure out where is best soon enough. If you can contact me through here, that works great.)
